            <p>
                Apex Legends is a first-person shooter battle royale game 
                in which players drop onto an island and fight to be the last person or team standing. 
                The game is set in the same universe as the Titanfall series, 
                but it has its own unique characters, weapons, and gameplay mechanics.
            </p>

            <p>
                this is one of the most noteable soundtracks form the game

            <p>
                The diverse 
                cast of characters known as "Legends" are the starting point of your apex legends adventure. 
                Each Legend has their own unique abilities, personalities, and backstory. 
                For example, Bangalore is a professional soldier who 
                can call in an artillery strike, while Mirage is a master of deception who can 
                create decoys to confuse enemies. Players can choose which Legend to play as. 
                The Legends are a big part of what makes Apex Legends so enjoyable and adds a 
                lot of depth to the gameplay.

            <img src="img/Apex_Legends/BrokenMoon.jpg" alt="a picture of the new map Broken Moon that was recently added to the game">

            <p>
                Recntly a new map was added "Broken Moon". Broken Moon is a new map that was added to Apex Legends. 
                It is set on a massive ship called the "IMC Planetary Survey Vessel" that is orbiting the planet Psamathe. 
                The map is smaller than the others, but it's also more vertical, featuring a lot of multi-level 
                buildings and tight corridors. The map is set in a dark and eerie environment, with the ship's 
                power systems being down and the only light source being the moon. The map is designed to encourage intense
                close-quarters combat and players have to be extra careful with the limited space and verticality. 
                The map is available to play in various modes and the players have to adjust their playstyle accordingly 
                to adapt to the new environment.
